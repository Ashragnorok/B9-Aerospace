// this is a sample config file, for determining a good file format for defining part parameters
// comment line - ignored by cfg parser
// empty lines, or lines without a '=' sign are also ignored
// all other lines are split at the '=' sign, and the left operand is used to know what parameter we are setting
// diferent parameters require data in different formats (see docs), and each module has it's own parameters (again, see docs)
// each assignment must be in a single line. Lines without assignments will be ignored. (You CAN turn on word wrap, though)
// each keyword here relates to an existing variable in the assigned module. If the keyword isn't found, it is ignored.
// conversely, if a keyword is left unassigned (as in not in the file), it will be initialized with it's default value
// This is done automatically, so any public variable defined in the loaded module can be accessed this way (provided it's value can be parsed)

description = This product was created as response to pilot complaints about imbalanced front mount position on M27 series cockpit. Now, with C125 Axial Adapter, you can carry as much weight right in front of your ship as you wish - without any risk! C125 prevents unwanted rotation under thrust, nausea, accidental deorbiting and rapid unplanned disassembly. Spin no more! As a bonus, innovative support structure allows you to maintain excellent vertical field of view, leaving space in front of the cockpit for you to look down right "through" your ship. Consider reinforcing connection to the pod with struts, as small 1.25m mount is prone to breaking under heavy load.
