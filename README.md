# Installation

Unpack everything to the root folder of the game, overwriting already existing GameData and Ships folders.

Source folder contains the source code for the included plugins and is not necessary for the mod to work.

Make sure you have KSP 0.22 or higher.

Support for KSP 0.21 is discontinued, use R3.4 if a compatible version is needed.

Support for KSP 0.20.2 is discontinued, use R3.2 if a compatible version is needed.

Versions below 0.20.2 are incompatible completely, even with older releases.

Do *not*, under any circumstances, extract just GameData/B9_Aerospace/Parts folder alone, the mod won't work this way.

With a proper installation, you should have multiple new folders in GameData alongside with Squad folder that was there originally.

Do not try to move the part folders anywhere or sort them by category subfolders, that will break resource linking in all configs.

If you are experiencing out of memory crashes in the game with this mod, we recommend you install the Active Texture Management mod. You can find it here: [forums](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/59005)

# About

This set of parts vastly expands a selection of parts, in particular with spaceplane components such as new engines, cockpits, wings and fuselage systems.

The style was influenced by futuristic concept art, modern UAV designs, some believable hard sci-fi ideas, DARPA & NASA aerospace research, and by asymmetrical shapes and faceted designs that are nowadays common everywhere from automotive industry to military aircraft.

I have decided not to go overboard with realistic art style or extreme colors: my intention is to make parts which would blend seamlessly with, for example, KW Rocketry pieces.

My textures are hand-painted, I’m avoiding photo-sourced areas or excessive detail like rust.

Everything looks just a little bit cartoony, like a concept art, which, in my opinion, fits nicely with the general art style of KSP (most of the stock part textures were painted too).

Although I’m going for higher fidelity and texture resolution, so don’t expect a 100% match – but I’m fairly satisfied with results and have already built some neat ships using them.

The goal of the project is to fill every empty niche in KSP part selection and to replace every sub-par component with a new part better suited for the role.

This is the fourth milestone release of the project, now featuring 210 new parts and fully compatible with KSP 0.22.

# Suggestions

These are some of the mods we like to use when we play KSP, in no particular order:


## Active Texture Management

Automatically compress textures and reduce them in size. 

No need for reduced texture packs any longer.

Highly configurable. [forum](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/59005)


## HotRockets!

We use its particle FX to make our engines look nice.

Get the main mod to make other engines look awesome too.

Supports lots of major mods as well as the Squad engines. Both HR and B9 use Sarbian's SmokeScreen, use whichever version of the plugin is the most recent.
[forum](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/65754)


## Firespitter

WW2-era aircraft and helicopter parts, seaplane floats.

The FS plugin enables lots of advanced functionality in B9, so even if you don't use the parts, updating to the most recent plugin is a good idea. [forum](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/24551)


## Ferram Aerospace Research

Accurate and realistic aerodynamics for KSP.

Wings stall, nosecones and payload fairings actually work, you can steer when aerobraking by turning your rocket. 

It'll change the way you design both planes and rockets. [forum](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/20451)


## Improved Chase Camera

An improved chase camera for planes.

Can be toggled at any time to return to the default functionality. [forum](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/80112)


## Renaissance Compilation

A compilation of visual mods.

Make KSP looks stupidly good. [forum](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/76972)


## Kerbal Aircraft Expansion

Modern style propeller engines and Helicopter parts.

Powered by firespitter. [forum](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/76668)


## Kethane

Scan for Kethane on planets and moons.

Then mine it, either use it as is in Kethane engines or refine it into fuel to refuel your missions or power self-sufficient remote bases. [forum](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/23979)


## Extraplanetary Launchpads

Mine for metal on planets and moons and build rockets with them.

Use together with Kethane to create your Kerbal Space Empire. [forum](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/59545)


## Kerbal Attachment System

Winches, magnets, tubes, EVA functionality.

Do a Curiosity-like flying crane rover landing, airlift splashed-down capsules with your helicopter, connect refueling pipes in EVA.

Use it with Kethane and EPL to connect your remote, self-built KSC together. [forum](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/53134)


## SCANsat

Satellite scanner parts to create detailed in-game maps of planets and moons.

Altitude, slope, biome and anomaly maps with zoom to help you plan your landings or look for that missing monolith. [forum](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/80369)


## Procedural Fairings

Payload fairings that automatically resize.

You can reshape and tweak them in the VAB, and use it to make custom inter-stage fairings as well. [forum](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/39512)


## Editor Extensions

Much needed extra functionality for the VAB/SPH.

After you've used it you won't be able to do without. [forum](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/38768)


## Raster Prop Monitor

Impressive Multi-function displays for IVA cockpit views.

Makes IVA-only piloting possible. Supports many major mods as well as Squad and B9 cockpits. [forum](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/57603)


## TAC Fuel Balancer

Automatically balance fuel between tanks, dump fuel, transfer a resource from/to all other tanks, or lock it so resources can't move in or out of it. Highly configurable.

While we design the B9 example crafts so its not necessary, it will make keeping your planes balanced as engines draw fuel much easier. [forum](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/25823)


## Enhanced Navball

Extra markers on the navball for Radial, Normal and anti-maneuver. Ghosting for Pro/Retrograde and Maneuver nodes.

Navball functionality that Squad wants to include but hasn't got round to doing yet. [forum](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/50524)


## Docking Port Alignment Indicator

Gives you the same information real astronauts have when docking. [forum](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/43901)


## KW Rocketry

Our favourite rocket parts expansion mod.

Fuel tanks of all sizes, more SRBs, more LF engines, payload fairings and many other associated parts. [forum](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/51037)


## Alternate Resource Panel

One that's actually useful and informative. [forum](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/60227)


## Procedural Wings

Wings and control surfaces you can scale and reshape in the VAB/SPH.

Give your plane the wings you imaged, or make the winglets on your rocket just right. [forum](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/29862)


## RCS Build Aid

Not just for RCS! Extra markers in the VAB/SPH.

Centre of Mass for empty fuel as well as full. See torque effects of off-centre engine and RCS thrust when designing crafts.

A great help for avoiding nasty surprises with changing center of mass and off-balance RCS. [forum](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/35996)
