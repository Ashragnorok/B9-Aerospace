B9 1.0.4 Compatibility Checklist

May not be complete

Already Done

* Stack node adjustments by V8jester and M4ck
* All textures converted to DDS
* CrossFeedEnabler, Firespitter, JSI, KM_Gimbal, SmokeScreen updates
* Recompile KineTechAnimation and Virgin Kalactic which have not been updated by their authors
* Re-entry thermals should be good now
* Cargo bays given new stock module and outer drag cubes applied
* Wings should work in stock aero now
* Intakes need rebalancing against new stock intakes
* bulkheadProfiles done, HX icon requires FilterExtensions
* Compressed air thrusters work without RESGEN
* Reconfigure tech nodes for new tech tree
* Jet engine configs largely done
* ModuleSurfaceFX added to all engines
* Cargo bays have inner stack nodes

To do

* Jet engine configs may still need tweaking
	* Thrust curves need validation in stock aero
	* Engine heating might still need tweaking
* Might be worth checking drag cubes on HL tail and HL-Mk4 adapter
* No drag cubes or internal nodes on HX parts yet
* Replace ModuleAnimateHeat with ModuleAnimateEmissive
* Rocket engines need Isp rebalanced to stock
* 1.0.3 heating changes
	* Spaceplane parts have their max temp increased
	* Certain parts (I see engines) have skinInternalConductionMult (4.0 for engines)
* Update ModuleScienceExperiment using stock parts as guide - flags have been expanded
* Update part costs and masses to be more in-line with stock
	* Probably exclude fuel tanks as the calculation is more complicated
* Intakes may need custom drag cubes.
* Breaking changes in RPM
	*JSIHeadsUpDisplay has been completely rewritten. Existing HUD configs written by other authors will have to be updated to the new format, or the HUD will only partially work. One benefit of the change is that the "black HUD textures in OpenGL" bug is dead.
	*JSIPrimaryFlightDisplay has been completely rewritten, as well. Existing PFD (navball) configs will need to be updated, or you won't see much of anything. Static Overlay textures have changed, as well (they now should be sized to match the size of the screen).
