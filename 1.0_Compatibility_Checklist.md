B9 1.0.2 Compatibility Checklist

May not be complete

Already Done

* Stack node adjustments by V8jester and M4ck
* Most textures converted to DDS
* CrossFeedEnabler, Firespitter, JSI, KM_Gimbal, SmokeScreen updates

To do

* Recompile KineTechAnimation and Virgin Kalactic which have not been updated
* Convert remaining textures to DDS (missed by DDS4KSP)
* Re-entry thermals
* Jet engine configs
	* velCurve defines thrust vs mach
	* atmCurve defines thrust vs density
	* tempMachLimit and machHeatMultiplier set mach limits on engine operation
* Cargo bays need new module for 1.0 aero
* All wings need adjustment for 1.0 aero (FAR should still be fine)
* Unknown if bizarre drag behavior still applies to intakes in stock aero
* bulkhead profiles
* See if ResGen is still necessary for compressed air thrusters
* Reconfigure tech nodes for new tech tree
