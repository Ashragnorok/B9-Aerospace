B9 1.0.2 Compatibility Checklist

May not be complete

Already Done

* Stack node adjustments by V8jester and M4ck
* All textures converted to DDS
* CrossFeedEnabler, Firespitter, JSI, KM_Gimbal, SmokeScreen updates
* Recompile KineTechAnimation and Virgin Kalactic which have not been updated by their authors
* Re-entry thermals should be good now
* bulkhead profiles mostly done

To do

* Jet engine configs
	* velCurve defines thrust vs mach
	* atmCurve defines thrust vs density
	* tempMachLimit and machHeatMultiplier set mach limits on engine operation
* Cargo bays need new module and drag cubes for stock aero
* All wings need adjustment for 1.0 aero (FAR should still be fine)
* Intakes need rebalancing against new stock intakes
* bulkhead profiles still need some adjustment - surface attachment may not be showing up and icons require FilterExtensions
* See if ResGen is still necessary for compressed air thrusters
* Reconfigure tech nodes for new tech tree
