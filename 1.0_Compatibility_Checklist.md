To do

* Jet engine configs may still need tweaking
* Might be worth checking drag cubes on HL tail
* Replace ModuleAnimateHeat with ModuleAnimateEmissive
* Update ModuleScienceExperiment flags have been expanded - do any parts need updating?
* Update remaining part costs and masses to be more in-line with stock
	* Probably exclude fuel tanks as the calculation is more complicated
* Intakes may need custom drag cubes.
