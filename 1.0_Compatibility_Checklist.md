B9 1.0.4 Compatibility Checklist

May not be complete

Already Done

* Stack node adjustments by V8jester and M4ck
* All textures converted to DDS
* CrossFeedEnabler, Firespitter, JSI, KM_Gimbal, SmokeScreen updates
* Recompile KineTechAnimation and Virgin Kalactic which have not been updated by their authors
* Re-entry thermals should be good now
* Cargo bays given new stock module and outer drag cubes applied
* Wings should work in stock aero now
* Intakes need rebalancing against new stock intakes
* bulkheadProfiles done, HX icon requires FilterExtensions
* Compressed air thrusters work without RESGEN
* Reconfigure tech nodes for new tech tree
* Jet engine configs largely done
* ModuleSurfaceFX added to all engines
* Cargo bays have inner stack nodes

To do

* Jet engine configs may still need tweaking
	* Hard or impossible to break sound barrier in stock aero - wait for changes in 1.0.3 to see
	* Engine heating might still need tweaking
* Might be worth checking drag cubes on HL tail and HL-Mk4 adapter
* No drag cubes or internal nodes on HX parts yet
* Replace ModuleAnimateHeat with ModuleAnimateEmissive
* Rocket engines need Isp rebalanced to stock
* 1.0.3 heating changes
	* Spaceplane parts have their max temp increased
	* Certain parts (I see engines) have skinInternalConductionMult (4.0 for engines)
* Update ModuleScienceExperiment using stock parts as guide - flags have been expanded
* Update part costs and masses to be more in-line with stock
	* Probably exclude fuel tanks as the calculation is more complicated
