IMPORTANT: 
You NEED to delete the old version before installing this one, or you’ll get a mess you aren’t likely to sort out.


RasterPropMonitor package version 0.17 or later is REQUIRED. (Without it, the pod won’t function at all.)

To display planetary maps, SCANsat mod version 6 is required. (If it is not installed, maps will not display, but everything else will keep working.)

To make use of autopilot functionality, you need MechJeb version 2.2.1.254 or later. (If it is not installed, autopilot menu will not work, 
but everything else will.)
