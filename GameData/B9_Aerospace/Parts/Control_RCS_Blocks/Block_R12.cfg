    description = An obvious choice for any sane aerospace engineer, this product has a tremendous advantage over earlier thruster block designs: it looks somewhat nice. Brightest kerbal scientists predict at least 600% decrease in aerodynamic drag in comparison with other thruster blocks by virtue of covering unsigthly mess of pipes and nozzles with a box. Twin nozzle design is another advantage, providing 2% more reliability at a small cost of doubled propellant consumption rate. Or not, it's not like we remember how we rigged the pipes in there.
