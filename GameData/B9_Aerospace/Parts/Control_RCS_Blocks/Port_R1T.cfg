    description = Timeless classic. Linear RCS ports are useful in thousands of situations and are used on every craft by every respectable spaceprogram. Buy one. No, better buy a hundred. RCS thrusters are used to rotate and translate your spacecraft in the absense of other means to do so (control surfaces won't help you turn outside of the atmoshpere and reaction wheels can't help you move to the side).
