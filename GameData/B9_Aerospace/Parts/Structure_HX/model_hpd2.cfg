    description = Enlarged version of HPD1, this enormous dual-mode engine was engineered for missions with extremely heavy payloads such as delivering HX modules to orbit or powering interplanetary transfers of structures exceeding thousands of tonnes. It combines the performance of a traditional closed-cycle rocket engine and that of a nuclear-powered LV-N engine in one propulsion assembly. The tech behind it is unclear and Tetragon Projects has declined to respond to inquiries, but it appears to use electromagnetic fields to direct and accelerate exhaust gases. The primary mode uses relatively small amounts of power, while secondary mode uses a smaller amount of exhaust gases and draws enormous amounts of power. Any design utilizing this engine will be most likely be forced to use 2 advanced power generators such as HX-URC18, although even their outputs are barely able to sustain the engine's secondary mode in a vacuum, necessitating a capacitor like HX-UB18. Attempts to power it with solar panel arrays have so far been unsuccessful.
