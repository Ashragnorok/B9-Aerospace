    description = This enormous engine was engineered for missions with extremely heavy payloads such as delivering HX modules to orbit or powering interplanetary transfers of structures exceeding thousands of tonnes. The tech behind it is unclear, but it seems to utilize electromagnetic acceleration of hydrogen plasma, explaining enormous power input required on top of the LF/O feed. Any design utilizing this engine will be most likely forced to use advanced power generator such as HX-URC18, although even it's output is not hight enough to sustain the engine, necessitating a capacitor like HX-UB18 and charging before every burn. Limited operation time complicates the use of the engine in atmosphere.
