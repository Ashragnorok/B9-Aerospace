# RasterPropMonitor

This is a showcase mod for RasterPropMonitor which adds a useful information display to certain stock and mod capsules. This is also the canonical source of RasterPropMonitor.dll plugin and associated files.

#INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:

Extract the contents of the GameData folder in the RPM zip file into the GameData folder of your KSP install.  You should see the following folder structure:

```
GameData |
         + JSI |
               + Agencies
               + RasterPropMonitor
               + RPMPodPatches
```

If you do not see GameData/JSI, you have installed this mod incorrectly, and it shall misbehave (missing props, other things not working right).

If you used CKAN to install this mod, check the file structure.  CKAN has installed this mod incorrectly in the past.  If it is installed incorrectly, remove this mod and install it manually.

If the plugin was listed as a dependency by some other mod author, and you do not want to use modified stock interiors, the JSI/RPMPodPatches directory may be safely deleted. Every capsule being modified has its own pair of patch config files -- you can safely delete only those you don't want.

##UPGRADING FROM OLDER VERSIONS:
v0.25.0 contains significant changes.  You should delete any existing installation.

JSIAdvTransparentPods is now a separate mod maintained by JPLRepo.  It can be found on GitHub at https://github.com/JPLRepo/JSIAdvTransparentPods .
