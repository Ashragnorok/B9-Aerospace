title = D25 Heavy Drone Core
manufacturer = Tetragon Projects
description = Heavy drone core for complex autonomous vessels. Allows front mounted equipment and works well as an adapter part in the middle of large ships. Unlike any other probe core, D25 has powerful torque suitable for controlling relatively heavyweight ships. But this comes at a price of high energy consumption. Get a good power source, otherwise it will run out of power pretty quickly.
