    description = What sorcery is this? That's right, it's an avionics package that actually fits to the size of your fuselages! This thing is outfitted with many wonderfully broken sensors and two ancient computers fighting each other in a rivalry over which readings are true. Nothing can go wrong: you better hurry and replace your outdated and primitive ASAS with this wonder.
