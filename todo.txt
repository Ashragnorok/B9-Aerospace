Radial RCS tanks
 * For spaceplanes, pseudo aerodynamic blocked-out teardop shape howeveryouwantit is what I was thinking. Something that would look good next to the DSI intake, the docking port, the ASAS on the side of an S2/HL fuselage :)
   Like the ones I made for my mod, which I found super-useful, in general concept. The stock or KSPX sort of stuck-on globe/tube doesn't look very good on most spaceplanes :)
 * The small one with the capacity of the stock sphere tank, and a bigger one uh, twice as big, 8 times the volume? KISS, do one and rescale? ;D


Sabre
 * Invent time machine to find time for the stuff below
 * Per-mode heat
 * Action group/mode labels
 * Secondary mode info in VAB
