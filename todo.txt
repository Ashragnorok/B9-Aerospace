Radial RCS tanks
 * For spaceplanes, pseudo aerodynamic blocked-out teardop shape howeveryouwantit is what I was thinking. Something that would look good next to the DSI intake, the docking port, the ASAS on the side of an S2/HL fuselage :)
   Like the ones I made for my mod, which I found super-useful, in general concept. The stock or KSPX sort of stuck-on globe/tube doesn't look very good on most spaceplanes :)
 * The small one with the capacity of the stock sphere tank, and a bigger one uh, twice as big, 8 times the volume? KISS, do one and rescale? ;D


!!! Check SAS descriptions style please :)


VA1/VS1 Nosecone & Pitot intake? One for ze rocket, one for the jet?


Winglets: One model, multiple sizes? In Pizza pack I found 3 were necessary, rescaleFactor 1, 1.415 and 2. That's double the surface area (and lift) of the smaller one each time.
Given the variance in size between the Mk1 and HL stuff, perhaps add a 4th, rescaleFactor = 2.828, gives you 8 times the surface area and lift of the very first one.
Iunno, typing out loud here.

Sabre
 * Invent time machine to find time for the stuff below
 * Per-mode heat
 * Action group/mode labels
 * Secondary mode info in VAB
